                  ...Cristal is amazing with our animals, she has truly became
                  part of the family! We have left out of town for 5 days and
                  not once was I ever worried if she gave them attention & care
                  they needed when I was away. I knew she had the knowledge and
                  also patience with them which is super needed & important
                  these days...
